# Marketing Campaigns
For the Maven Marketing Challenge, you will be assuming the role of a newly-hired BI consultant for Maven Marketing, a small digital marketing agency. Their latest marketing campaigns have underperformed, and they have brought you in to analyze their data and propose a solution.

## Task
Pitch your No.1 recommendation to improve the impact of future marketing campaigns, and show the analysis to support it.

## Design and Approach
* Calculate conversion rates for each campaign. Calculated by dividing the number of leads by the total number of people who were exposed to the campaigns

  **Conversion rates**
  
  > Campaign 1 - 6.4%
  
  > Campaign 2 - 1.3% poor performnce
  
  > Campaign 3 - 7.3%
  
  > Campaign 4 - 7.5% good performance
  
* Using the data (number of leads as the metric) to compare performance of campaigns that performed good with the one performed poorly
* Create an infograph to share the insights
